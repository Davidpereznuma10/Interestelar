# app.js

`app.js` is the main entry point of Backend Node.js application. It sets up and configures an Express.js web server to handle HTTP requests and defines various middleware, routes, and services required for the application.

Key components and functionality of `app.js` include:

1. **Dependencies**: The file imports various Node.js modules and libraries to enable features like session management, CORS handling, authentication, and error handling. Notable dependencies include `express`, `dotenv`, `session`, `cors`, `passport`, and more.

2. **Configuration**: It loads configuration settings from the `.env` file using `dotenv`. These settings, such as the server's port and host, are stored in the `config` object.

3. **Session Management**: Configures and uses `express-session` to manage user sessions. This is essential for handling user authentication and maintaining user state.

4. **Passport.js Integration**: Initializes and uses `passport` for handling user authentication. Passport is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js applications.

5. **JSON and CORS Handling**: Configures middleware to handle JSON data and enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from different origins.

6. **API Routes**: Sets up API routes using the `RouterApi` function defined in the `./routers/index.js` file. This is where the various routes for your application are defined and organized.

7. **Error Handling Middleware**: Uses custom error-handling middleware functions, including `logErrors`, `boomError`, and `errorHandler`, to handle errors that may occur during request processing and provide appropriate responses.

8. **Server Initialization**: Starts the Express.js server and listens on the specified port and host. It also logs the server's URL and MongoDB connection URI to the console.

9. **Data Import**: The lines at the end of the file include functions like `getCourseData` and `getUsersData`. These functions are responsible for importing data into your application, presumably from external sources like APIs or databases. `getUsersData()` is called during server startup.
